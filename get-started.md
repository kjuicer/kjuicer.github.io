## 1. Create your account
Creating a user makes sure that your documents will be saved under your wall, be it because you save them through the extension or if you upload them, as well as allow you to mark as preferred documents that you find on our wall and save them for later use.
Click on the login button in the top right corner of any Kjuicer page (for example <a href="http://alpha.kjuicer.com/cache/484/show/#k:+yGIUFprUDnFUbP8S/2ewH5BM401tVdly/vLyxiCfn4=,l:4,c:on" target="_blank">Kjuicer</a>), choose Mozilla Persona and create your account if you do not already have one.  
It is the classic standard procedure: it will ask you for your email and to create a password, then send a confirmation email with a link that needs to be clicked upon to activate the account. 

## 2. Install the extension or...
The extension allows you to cache a standard web page and turn it into a page that can be highlighted with the Kjuicer.

The Kjuicer currently works best on Firefox or Chrome, and we have developed an extension for both browsers. 
Install:
  - [Firefox extension][kj1]
  - [Chrome extension][kj2]

As soon as you install the extension you will see a stylized juicer button on your browser's toolbar. When you find a web page that you would like to highlight with the Kjuicer click on it: you will be brought to a Kjuicer page ready for being highlighted. If you have an account and are logged in, the page will be automatically saved on your *Personal Wall*.

In case you do not want to use either Firefox or Chrome you might still be able to use the Kjuicer on other browsers: reading a *kjuiced* document should be possible from any browser. You might also be able to *kjuice* documents if your browser supports bookmarks.
You can find the Kjuicer bookmark on the [extensions shortcut page][kj2]. It's the red button at the bottom. You should click and drag the button to your favorites' toolbar, and any time you find a page that you would like to *kjuice*, simply click on the bookmark.

## 3. Read a *kjuiced* page
If you have a page that has already been highlighted with the Kjuicer, you can read it by clicking on the colored dots at the bottom:
> the **yellow** dot will bring you to the shortest summary, and will show only the most concentrated juice, or what has been higlighted in yellow;

> the **light green** button will show you a larger summary, composed of the yellow and light green highlights, while 

> the **dark green** button will propose you with all the content that has been highlighted by the author, i.e. yellow + light green + dark green highlights, which is the longest summary of the original content.

> the **white button** will bring you to the original content.

Clicking on any word or sentence in the summaries will instruct the Kjuicer to expand the content displayed at the next level of summary: a little bit like zooming in while browsing a map, it will show you more details. If you click back to a shorter summary color, the Kjuicer will get you back to the previously selected word or sentence.

In case you want to modify the highlights, click on the button *Edit* at the bottom left corner. 
> If you own the document, or it is open for changes, the background of the navigation bar will turn white 
> and you will be able to select the desired highlighter.

> In case you don't own the document and it is not open for change by others, you will be prompted if you 
> want to **fork** it, i.e. copy it and create your own version, which will still have the highlights available 
> for editing.

## 4. Highlight a *kjuiced* page
As soon as you click on the Kjuicer extension or the bookmark, or you choose *Edit* on a *kjuiced* page, the background of the navigation bar will turn white and you will be able to select the desired highlighter. 

Once you have selected your color it will stay until you change your choice, and any text you select will be highlighted in the desired color. 

You can change color by clicking on a different color, or also by using the keyboard shortcuts: 1 activates the yellow highlighter, 2 the light green one, 3 dark green, 4 activates the white one, which is the eraser.

In order for the summarizing mechanism to work properly and to allow it to create your prioritized notes and different sized summaries, you should highlight the text keeping in mind that:
> the text you highlight should be re-readable all by itself, including necessary spaces and punctuation;
> yellow should be used for the most important concepts, light green for supporting parts, dark green for >everything else that you want to make note of;

**When you are done highlighting**, or want to check the resulting summaries click on the **check** button at the bottom left corner.

**If you made a mistake** you can use the **undo** or **redo** buttons at the right of the bottom bar.
