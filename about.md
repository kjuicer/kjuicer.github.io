title: "READING GETS SUPER POWERS"
---

The Knowledge Juicer is a tool that leverages a simple, hierarchical underlining process, to extract multiple levels of summary out of digital texts, with corresponding levels of synthesis.

It does so in a way that the original content's usefulness multiplies, for the reader himself but also for whoever he can, and wishes to, share his findings with. It can be applied to structure simple web pages for sharing purposes, and used as a bridge from Twitter-like short statements to full papers, or to process large documents and collections thereof.

This work makes reading, learning and studying significantly simpler, and subsequent readings become much more efficient through an easy and powerful navigation interface. It allows for easy tracking or drilling of important topics and conclusions extracted from the text. Those will stay in time, and will be easily re-accessible from multiple platforms and to multiple users.

The navigation interface allows readers that work on complex content to go back to any previously identified topic in just three clicks, improving learning dramatically: when complexity steepens up, the KJuicer allows readers to clarify references to previous concepts with unprecedented speed. In our tests the tool has been so effective that we estimate that transforming written concepts into workable knowledge can happen up to 5x faster.

It also generates major benefits for users who come after the first, if needed: they will immediately identify the key points that the first reader underlined, sparing them from complete reading if they are not interested, are familiar with the content or some of its parts; they will be able to browse the text, rather than being forced to access it linearly, yet they will always have the option to investigate interesting points by expanding them with several levels of detail, down to the full text.

The KJuicer can also be viewed and used as a sort of "crowdsourced" text mining, through which readers can synthesize their understandings of vast collections of documents and share them, for the benefit of those who come after them or a team, both in private and in public.

Readers who read kjuiced versions of a document will be able to express their appreciations for the original work and its summaries, but also find out who kjuiced a text, which might facilitate the choice between the different vantage points of the same content.
